/*Description
Please read the question carefully, use variable names provided and match output format exactly.
you are required to write a County.java class to represent a County. Every County has a name(name), an area(area) and a number of All-Ireland football wins(footballWins)(as shown in the table below). Your class must use the variable name
with the appropiate data types to store these variables. You are also required to write a general constructor, along with getter and setter methods and a toString() method for the class.

You are required to write a SortCounty.java file, which we use data to declare an array of 5 County objects within the main method. The data for your 5 County objects will be given using user input.
Bellow is the given data for 5 Counties:

County Name         Area           Football Wins
Mayo                5585.25        3
Wexford             2352.65        5
Meath               2342.0         7
Cavan               1931.57        6
Derry               2074.26        1

You should then write a static Java method, which takes an array of the County objects as a parameter and returns nothing.This method should sort the County objects array based on the number of All-Ireland wins using the Bubble sort algorithm. It should be sorted from smallest to largest.
The Method signature shuld look like this:
public static void bubbleSortCounty(County data[])
You will then write a static Java Method, in SortCounty.java, which takes in the sorted array as a paramameter and returns nothing. The Java method should use the toString() method in County.java to print out the sorted array.
The Method signature should look like this:
public static void printCountyArray(County data[])

Sample Input for 1. County
