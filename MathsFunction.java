/*Description

    a(n) = | a(1) = 2,              n = 1
           | a(n) = 4a(n-1)-3n,     n >= 2
Given the Maths Function definition above for a mathematical function 
a(n) you are required to write two Java methods â€“ both methods will be in the same class.

An iterative method which calculates a(n) for any positive value of n. 
In this method you must use either a for or a while loop. You should 
call this method q1Iterative and it should have a definition as follows: 
public static int q1Iterative(int n)
A recursive method which calculates a(n) for any positive value of n. 
You should call this method q1Recursive. The definition of the method 
should be declared as follows: public static int q1Recursive(int n)
Both Java methods should only return the single value of a(n). 
They should not print any other values.

Input = n, an integer value.
Sample Input 1 = 1
Output = The method will print the value of a(n) for each method 
(which is a(1) in this case) on the same line separated by a space

Sample Output 1 = 2 2
Sample Input 2 = 5
Output = The method will print the value of a(n) for each method 
(which is a(5) in this case) on the same line seperated by a space

Sample Output 2 = -79 -79*/
